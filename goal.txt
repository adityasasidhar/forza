To confirm the first task, here is the planned step-by-step flow with a short explanation:

1) Upload Analytical Balance Sheet â€“ The user uploads the detailed balance sheet (Excel or PDF) when the company files in micro or abbreviated format.
ðŸ‘‰ Allow the user to upload up to 5 balance sheets (not only one).

2) AI Mapping â€“ The platform automatically reads each accounting item (Roman numerals and letters) and identifies them.

3) Reclassification â€“ These items are then placed into the correct EU-compliant structure (Article 2424), even if some items are missing or grouped differently.

4) Validation Check â€“ The system ensures that Assets = Liabilities, applying a rounding rule (e.g., <1 euro) if small differences exist.

5) Final Output â€“ The user receives a reclassified Excel sheet, ready to be used for financial analysis and reporting.
